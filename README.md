# UcsApplicationSkeleton
Example skeleton for usc-based app (by CJames)
Instructions:
1. ensure you have the [https://github.com/cjsoftware-lib/ucsFramework] project locally by 'git clone https://github.com/cjsoftware-lib/ucsFramework.git'.  Or you could use the snapshot I made on 9/Mar/2018; 'git clone https://github.com/manangatangy/CjSoftwareUscFramework.git'.
2. build it using gradle target 'clean assemble install'.  This will place in local maven repo.
3. create a new repo for the new app, by importing from https://github.com/manangatangy/UcsApplicationSkeleton into a new [app-name] repo.
4. edit the [app-name] README to something appropriate.
5. git clone https://github.com/manangatangy/[app-name]  the new project and build it locally.
